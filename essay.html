    <h1>
        My father
    </h1>
    <pre>
    My father is a remarkable individual who has had an immeasurable impact on my life. He is not only my dad but also my role model, mentor, and best friend. My father’s love for
    me is unconditional and unwavering. He has always been there for me, through thick and thin, and has never let me down. He is the one person in my life who has always believed
    in me, even when I didn’t believe in myself.
    My father is a businessman and is quite disciplined in all aspects of life. He is the one who taught me to always practice discipline no matter what work I do. Most importantly
    , he has a jovial nature and always makes my mother laugh with his silly antics even after 27 years of marriage. I completely adore this silly side of him when he is with his
    loved ones. He tries his best to fulfill all our wishes but also maintains the strictness when the need arises. One of the best things I love about my father is that he has
    always kept a very safe and open home environment. For instance, my siblings and I can talk about anything with him without the fear of being scolded or judged. This has
    helped us not to lie, which I have often noticed with my friends. In addition, my father has an undying love for animals which makes him very sympathetic towards them.
    He practices his religion devotedly and is very charitable too. I have never seen my father misbehave with his elders in my entire life which makes me want to be like him
    even more.
    I can proudly say that it is my father who has been my source of inspiration from day one. In other words, his perspective and personality together have shaped me as a person.
    Similarly, he has a great impact on the world as well in his own little ways. He devotes his free time in taking care of stray animals which inspires me to do the same.
    My father has taught me the meaning of love in the form of a rose he gifts to my mother daily without fail. This consistency and affection encourage all of us to treat them 
    the same way. All my knowledge of sports and cars, I have derived from my father. It is one of the sole reasons why I aspire to be a cricket player in the future.
    To sum it up, I believe that my father has it all what it takes to be called a real-life superhero. The way he manages things professionally and personally leaves me
    mesmerized every time. No matter how tough the times got, I watched my father become tougher.
